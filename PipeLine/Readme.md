#### 2. Quality Control
- **Tools**: NanoPlot, FastQC, pycoQC  
- **Purpose**: Assess the quality of the sequencing reads.
- **Details**: These tools provide various metrics such as read length distribution, base quality scores, and overall sequencing quality to identify potential issues with the data before downstream processing.

#### 3. Read Filtering and Trimming
- **Tools**: Filtlong, Porechop  
- **Purpose**: Remove low-quality reads and trim adapter sequences.
- **Details**: Filtlong filters out low-quality reads based on length and quality, while Porechop trims adapter sequences from the reads to improve alignment accuracy.

#### 4. Alignment to Reference Genome
- **Tool**: Minimap2  
- **Purpose**: Align filtered reads to the reference **Mycobacterium tuberculosis** genome.
- **Details**: Minimap2 is highly effective for aligning long-read data to a reference genome, essential for accurate variant calling.

#### 5. Variant Calling
- **Tools**: Medaka, Nanopolish, Clair3, Snippy  
- **Purpose**: Identify SNPs, indels, and other genetic variants.
- **Details**:  
  - **Medaka** and **Nanopolish** are optimized for Nanopore data and improve variant calling accuracy by leveraging the unique characteristics of long reads.  
  - **Clair3** uses deep learning to call variants in challenging genomic regions and supports both short and long-read data.

  - **Bcftools** is used to filter low-quality or low-confidence variants to improve the reliability of downstream analyses.  
  - **SnpEff** annotates variants to predict their effects on gene function, which is crucial for understanding potential impacts on drug resistance.

#### 8. Drug Resistance Profiling
- **Tools**: TBProfiler, mykrobe  
- **Purpose**: Predict drug resistance profiles from identified variants.
- **Details**:  
  - **TBProfiler** uses a comprehensive database of TB mutations associated with drug resistance to predict resistance profiles directly from sequencing data.  
  - **mykrobe** performs a similar function and provides additional insights into lineage and strain type.

#### 9. Phylogenetic and Structural Analysis
- **Tools**: PSA (Phylogenetic Structural Analysis Model)  
- **Purpose**: Analyze phylogenetic relationships and structural variants.
- **Details**: PSA models the evolutionary relationships between strains and can detect structural variations, aiding in understanding TB transmission dynamics.

#### 10. Polishing the Assembly (Optional)
- **Tools**: Medaka, Racon, Pilon (if hybrid assembly)  
- **Purpose**: Improve the accuracy of a genome assembly.
- **Details**: If performing a de novo assembly, tools like Medaka and Racon can polish the assembly based on Nanopore data, with Pilon used to further refine assemblies when hybrid short-read data is available.

#### 11. Visualization and Reporting
- **Tools**: IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer), JBrowse  
- **Purpose**: Visualize the alignment and variants and generate reports.
- **Details**: These visualization tools provide graphical representations of genomic data, aiding in the interpretation of variant calls and the identification of clinically relevant mutations.
